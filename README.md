# partyplanner_app

A Flutter project for the AAD specialisation at Saxion.

## Requirements

All included requirements are included below.

### Must

[x] The app works on Android and iOS.  
[x] The application should save the list of parties and people who are invited.  
[x] The app has some sort of professional (native?) styling.  
[x] The app shows a list of upcoming parties and gives the user the ability to add one.  
[x] When the user clicks adds a party he/she can put then name, the description and the date of the party.  
[x] Add the party to the phone agenda immediately after creating the party.  
[x] Allow the user to add persons to the party. When the user presses the button the phones contact list should appear and the user can select a contact.  
[x] Allow the user to send an invitation to the party people. You can do this with plugins the framework has available. Otherwise an enhanced mailto:// URL should work.

### Should

[x] Add edit functionality to edit the name, description and date and time of the party  
[ ] Make sure to update the agenda! (Plugin works inconsistently. Prompts user to make a new calendar item, but does not remove old item.)  
[x] Also enable the removal of users from the party.

### Could

[ ] Add a location to the party and share this with the other party people.  
[ ] Sends update notifications by mail when you updated the party.  
[ ] Add full-blown calendar integration, with real (iCal) invitations and free/busy scheduling
